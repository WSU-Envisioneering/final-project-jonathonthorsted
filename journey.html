    <p>This summer in WEB 1400, I learned how to build websites from scratch using HTML and CSS. I discovered how to structure content using semantic elements, style pages with external stylesheets, and create layouts using flexbox and grid. It’s been a fun and valuable experience that gave me tools I’ll use for a long time.</p>
    <p>I really enjoyed the hands-on projects — they helped everything make sense. If I could change anything, I’d want even more practice with JavaScript and maybe more examples of real websites. Overall, I feel proud of what I made and excited to keep learning!</p>
